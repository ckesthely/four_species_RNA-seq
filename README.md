# four_species_RNA-seq

The shell and R scripts listed here were written for the analysis of RNA-Seq data from a four microbe community consisting of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. sanguinis, and P. melaninogenica. All samples were grown up as a biofilm in 96 well plates prior to removing the planktonic fraction and scraping off the biofilm fraction with a 96pin replicator. RNA was purified through the use of Qiagenâ€™s RNeasy RNA purification kit. Monospecies samples were sequenced to 12.5M reads, while polymicrobial samples were sequenced to 25M reads. The code was written to analyze the data uploaded to the NCBI SRA database (Accession number PRJNA971914).



All utilized R libraries are listed at the top of the R markdown script.
